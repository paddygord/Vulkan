# C++ Vulkan examples and demos

This is a fork of [Sascha Willems](https://github.com/SaschaWillems) excellent [Vulkan examples](https://github.com/SaschaWillems/Vulkan) with some modifications.  

* All of the code except for the VulkanDebug stuff has been ported to use the [Vulkan C++ API](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/Vulkan-Hpp)
* All platform specific code for Windows and Linux has been consolidated to use [GLFW 3.2](http://www.glfw.org/)
* Project files for Visual Studio have been removed in favor of a pure [CMake](https://cmake.org/) based system
* Binary files have been removed in favor of CMake external projects
* Enable validation layers by default when building in debug mode
* Avoid excessive use of vkDeviceWaitIdle and vkQueueWaitIdle
* Avoid excessive use of explicit image layout transitions, instead using implicit transitions via the RenderPass and Subpass definitions

## Known issues

* I've only tested so far on Windows using VS 2013, 2015 & VS 2017.  
* I'm still cleaning up after the migration to `Vulkan.hpp` so the code isn't as clean as it could be.  Lots of unnecessary function parameters and structure assignments remain

# Building

Use the provided CMakeLists.txt for use with [CMake](https://cmake.org) to generate a build configuration for your toolchain.  Using 64 bit builds is strongly recommended.
